# こんにちは! I'm Tatiana

I'm a **junior developer** eager to grow professionally.  

Currently, I work with **React** for frontend development, automated testing using **Selenium with Java** for automated testing, and I also develop backend solutions using **Go** and **PHP**.


In my free time, I practice **React** and **Java**, which are my favorite areas at the moment, and I'm also learning **Japanese**.

🌸 Outside of coding, I enjoy watching **series and movies** and going for walks to get some vitamin D.
