# こんにちは! I'm Tatiana

I'm a **junior developer** eager to grow professionally.  
Currently, I work with **React** and automated testing using **Selenium with Java**.

In my free time, I practice **React**, which is my favorite area at the moment, and I'm also learning **Japanese**.

🌸 Outside of coding, I enjoy watching **series and movies** and going for walks to get some vitamin D.

Let's connect!
